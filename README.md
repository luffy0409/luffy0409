## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps Engineer with a knack for designing scalable, secure, and production-ready systems. I specialize in building and deploying containerized workloads using Docker and Kubernetes, automating cloud infrastructure with Terraform, and setting up full observability pipelines using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.

I'm all about delivering resilient, cost-effective cloud-native solutions that power real-time applications and services. Currently, I'm diving deeper into Kubernetes internals, performance tuning, and cloud automation best practices.
